electronics_happy__After reading all of the reviews of this new set on Prime Day, I wanted to come back and leave a review for the set. I ordered it yesterday at a great price, and it arrived today around 9am! Wow that was quick (gotta love Prime).
electronics_indifferent__On the second day of useage, starting the computer from a shutdown, computer froze. After hard reset, two pixels were stuck. After ignoring it and playing for about 30 minutes I noted that the dead pixel spots were resolved and continued to play. Shut the laptop off briefly and resumed playing again and all went well.
electronics_sad__The Wi-Fi adapter quit working correctly. Troubleshooted the problem and found out that the adapter is faulty or not connected properly. I didn't want to open it because I would lose my warranty. I had to restart the laptop in order to see the adapter in the settings. Sometimes it would not even show up, only the LAN connection would. This laptop is completely useless if there's no connectivity to the internet. Also, the screen has a defect and it would be showing a yellow tint on the bottom right which is bothering me just a little.
clothing_happy__The shirt is exactly what I expected from Lacoste & the service was precisely what I expect from Amazon.com
clothing_indifferent__I always buy a size 5 for Lacoste but they have switched the size 5 from a Medium to a Large. Although Lacoste says that if you wear a size 5 before the change, you should still buy a size 5, this long sleeve polo is definitely larger than past ones. Have to go to the store and try out a size 4 now to see if that is a better fit. Maybe a few runs in the dryer will shrink it enough for a better fit.
clothing_sad__I know it's my fault, I shouldn't have expected much at this price, but this is seriously one of the worst garments I have ever purchased. Also, I ordered in 2X, received 3X, and the 3X fits like an American Medium. Seriously, do not buy this product. It is terrible.
automotive_happy__Helmet was way better than I thought it would be..I've had many helmets over the years and this has been the biggest bang for your buck
automotive_indifferent__It left a fog on the windshield afterward, but it did work on getting rid of the ice
automotive_sad__Absolute junk if you own a truck to actually work. Ordered a set of 4 and they lasted not quite 6 months. I had 7 plugs in one tire and at least 4 in all the rest. Treads separated in about 5800 miles and wear wasterrible. Do yourself a favor and buy BFGs or GoodYear workhorses. Definitely do not buy "P" radials. Go get yourself a REAL truck tire. Junk.
movies_happy__This is an X-men movie for adults. It is absolutely hilarious, dirty, raunchy, full of foul language and nudity and I loved it.
movies_indifferent__The superheroes saga continue where they are put at odds against each other in 2 groups to battle but where was HULK?. Maybe he was not included to the party? New superheroes are introduced for the first time and is joined by a special appearance of Spiderman!
movies_sad__not much story. just one fight scene after another
food_happy__Raw apple cider vinegar is a super food. As we age, we produce less hydrochloric acid. This stuff (1 T diluted in a glass of water, so as not to harm teeth enamel) will help your digestion. It also helps with weight loss, supposedly by blocking some of the starch absorption. Like tumeric, it is a natural remedy for literally dozens of things. It really helps with bloating. When I plan to eat out, or go to a potluck, I carry some with me in a small bottle.
food_indifferent__The cookies were fresh but a lot of the packages had only 2 cookies
food_sad__arrived damaged. This time much worse. It's as if the case were dropped on it's side. The tops of the cans are protruding making it impossible to drink from. Some appear to have leaked/seal broken from the impact/pressure. Very disappointed. Also, they will not exchange/return this item. Beware when purchasing this item, it's a gamble on what you'll receive.
