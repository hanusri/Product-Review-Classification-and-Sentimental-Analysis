electronics_happy__LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them "echolettes" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them.
electronics_happy__Had no idea what I was getting so it impressed me and still does.
electronics_happy__Very happy with purchase. I have had 4 phones in the past year. Needless to say I'm very hard on them! I have returned to Samsung as the other brands just didn't measure up. I use Straight Talk and have for years. Had no problems changing over, just check to make sure it works in your area! Hopefully this will be my last phone for awhile!!
electronics_happy__very good! I like GTX1070 and cooling system.........
electronics_happy__All around great product. Had some minor bugs to work out but all is good now. The only thing I would change about it is the spacing on the keys could be a small bit more spread out but other than that it is a fantastic machine.
electronics_happy__Love it so far. Have not had any issues like my last laptop that crashed after owning for only less then 90 days. Doesn't have tons of crap downloaded that I did not want. Great purchase!!
electronics_indifferent__So after having owned a Surface Pro 3 (which I love,) I decided to get a Surface Book.
electronics_indifferent__Over the time it feels like an another windows laptop. Unless you are an artist you might not use the touch feature mutch and windows as an operating system improved a lot over the years but still not there yet.
electronics_indifferent__I'm a big fan of the Surface series, but this was a huge disappointment. In my first 30 minutes of using this, I noticed that the device did not charge, and the screen was loose at a corner. I returned it and will wait until the Surface Book 2 is released with fixed build issues.
electronics_indifferent__So I bought SB(not from amazon) since I work out of office a lot. And that's why my SB is without discrete graphic card - to have a extra battery life.
electronics_indifferent__This was a refurbished model, It came to me with a small chip on right lower corner and some minor chip in other areas.
electronics_indifferent__ I did some research on internet and figured no matter what I do out there in the market there is no way I am getting a Samsung curved UHD tv for this price.
electronics_sad__I also had some issues with Windows 10 on this laptop and with the MSI-specific software. For instance, MSI has the Dragon Center software and one of the most annoying features to me was part of the virtual desktop. As I moved some windows (Steam, for example) around my screen a tiny pop-up window would come up and if I let go of the window in the wrong place it would suddenly expand horizontally across the screen, but only fill the desktop about half-way, vertically. When I tried to bring up the built-in manual (also available in Dragon Center, according to the icon) I received an error and was unable to get any help. A web search finally indicated that the feature was part of the MSI software and not Windows 10, as I had suspected. I turned this feature off and it has been fine since.
electronics_sad__Speakers are very poor quality, if I bring the speaker volume above 5 percent they start to crackle and everything is distorted, so I can choose to listen to games and music at a whisper or with terrible crackling distortion. I expected more from MSI.
electronics_sad__ The laptop wont receive power because the AC adapter failed the second day. So now i have a very expensive paperweight sitting on my desk. Went to MSI support and they gave me the stupid suggestion to reset the battery on the laptop when i already had said the problem wasnt the laptop itself but the AC adapter. Two days later and still no response on getting it exchanged. The computer itself however was working fine until the battery died. Will update review again when/if i get a response from MSI support.
electronics_sad__Killer Networking network is complete die. Customer service line is full everyday. I have called for one week. Now I returned it. If you are thinking of purchasing MSI laptops I would suggest you find other brand.
electronics_sad__I used the Samsung for 5 months and the screen went black--called Samsung and they indicated they would repair under warrenty. Once they received the phone they indicated the color of the phone did not match the serial no.--and that it was not authorized. Why am I sold a telephone by Amazon that is not authentic or authorized??? I will attempt to return the phone to Amazon
electronics_sad__The pixels and internal screen itself are completely damaged. The box does not appear to have damage and the screen does not look damaged until you turn it on
clothing_happy__Really liked the shirt! Good quality and fits like a glove!
clothing_happy__Very comfortable. It's a Gildan brand, unisex sweatshirt, so not form fitting. I'm 5'9 & 135lbs and I ordered a Medium. It's a little baggy but not in a bad way, not too bulky. So soft on the indside. Very comfortable sweatshirt. 
clothing_happy__Oh my gosh .. This is so cute. Hard to find great gifts for boy babies and this little outfit is so adorable. Will be perfect for fall weather.
clothing_happy__Bought these for my Wife because she is always working out....my teenage girl stole them already ....after the first day. She loves them. Very comfy and stylish as well. Great product for the price and look great as well.
clothing_happy__It came before the estimate date. The dress is too short for me to wear as is. I have to put some leggings on. But satisfied with the fit. I'm plus sized by the way
clothing_happy__I love this sweatshirt. It fitted me a bit weird but I'm a woman wearing a men's hoodie, so logic says that it was going to be that way. I still wear it almost all the time.
clothing_indifferent__Ok so I ordered a size up and although it fits it is definitely not the slim fit i expected. I assume it would have been more form fitting in my true size without being tight but I am not sure about the sleeves.
clothing_indifferent__looks exactly as presented. Ordered Large which was too small for a slender athletic female teen
clothing_indifferent__The fleece part is really soft and cozy, unlike Columbia baby fleeces that feel like felt. The outfit seems well made and comfy, but I really wish the sizes were more reasonable. This outfit is WAY too small for the age listed on the label!
clothing_indifferent__I was hoping this would be form-fitting like the photo, but it just isn't. It makes a comfortable nightgown, but don't get your hopes up for something sexy.
clothing_indifferent__My student really wanted a pair, so I bought her a pair given that she is one if my honor role students and not even a week this happened to my pair. I sure would like to hope that she gets a better pair.
clothing_indifferent__The size is appropriate, if a bit on the narrow side, and it is cut for men, mind you. It comes in a plethora of colors, and there is even a short sleeve version for warmer weather. I would not wear this to work out, and it is not of a weight intended for colder weather, but would make a great layering piece, over an under shirt and turtleneck and under another jacket for those windy, biting, cold and snowy days.
clothing_sad__France crocodile is terrible, bought a 4 t a T-shirt and large code nominal chest (in inches) 40.94, equivalent to 103.98cm, and practical for (in inches) 47.24, equivalent to 120cm. big (in inches) 6.3.. behind 3 are basically the same.
clothing_sad__The material is not premium; quality seems similar to the H&M brand. Hope this helps.
clothing_sad__I waited a month and a half for my sweater and when I finally received it, it was incredibly too small. I'd rather my money back than to wait another month and a half for another too small sweater.
clothing_sad__When this product arrived, it arrived without any hangers and tags and was folder as if it was out of laundry. Unfortunately we had purchased two of these products to gift someone and really had to give it a second thought because of the way it arrived!
clothing_sad__These "Like a Boss" leggings are not good quality. I bought a pair as a gift for my niece and said she only wore them twice and they already got a tear in them. She said they are not worth buying.
clothing_sad__Very disappointed in this top/dress, it's nothing like the picture. Ordered size M based on recommendations and it was too wide in the waist and sleeves/shoulders, but the bottom part was really tight. Did not flatter the body at all. Material cheap. But I guess for that price you can't ask for much.
automotive_happy__After checking local tire shops I found the best price on Amazon. Free shipping closed the deal. I run these tires on my FJ Cruiser. They are great for street driving but perform real well off road. We do some serious 4 wheeling in the Colorado Rockies and they work great crawling over rocks, boulders and in mud. They do great in snow as well. 
automotive_happy__I bought these tires Nov. 9th 2013. I couldn't have been happier when i got them. Awesome tread design. Excellent handling
automotive_happy__So glad i purchased this Ice-Off for my husband. I get to park in the garage and he parks his truck outside. Most mornings we are able to warm up his truck so windows can defrost or snow can melt. However there are some mornings that this does not happen. A few sprays on the windshield and windows and he is set to go. No scrapping required.
automotive_happy__works great with my nissan boss kit
automotive_happy__Great Steering Wheel,
automotive_happy__Arrived promptly. I have owned a number of similar heated seats over the years. This one is slim and comfortable, heats quickly, the two settings are useful and easy to use. Great, particularly for the price. 
automotive_indifferent__Works as advertised. There is no indication the filter is active except that it darkens the glare. I wish there was a little LED or something to confirm I'm protected
automotive_indifferent__Had these mounted a month back. So far treadwear is very very minimal on the front, non existent on the back (2007 dodge ram crew cab). Had a chance to test it out in a variety of conditions, heres how it went...
automotive_indifferent__Runs out very quickly for the price but helped on mornings when I didn't have time to wait for the defroster to do it's magic.
automotive_indifferent__Bought this for a racing mower was expecting the center part for the shafts may of overlooked it not having one but a nice steering wheel
automotive_indifferent__The leather was wrapped loose and moved around quite a bit while driving. The spokes were not bent evenly so it never looked straight. No where near name brand quality like my Momo Mod 08.
automotive_indifferent__It slides around on leather seats. It warms okay, but because half of the energy is being expended into the heat.
automotive_sad__Did not fit on my Buick Lucerne... even though they said they would.
automotive_sad__Okay, well they seem study and are very shiny. But be aware that while these will fit a 9/16inch stud, the lug wrench size has been reduced to 13/16 inch and not 7/8 inch which is the original size. I didn't notice that bit of information until after I tried to install them. So I can't use them because the smaller diameter means that they don't look anything like the other lug nuts. And of course you would need two sockets to change tires etc, ugh. Who knew there were so many variables when buying a lug nut? It also didn't help that the Amazon website assured me that this product would indeed fit my 2007 Dodge Durango.
automotive_sad__Not a good hood at all. Burned my eyes the very first day I used it.
automotive_sad__Don't get sucked in to the high list price and then the great discount offered on it. It's just garbage, you will not be able to get anything good out of it. DON'T WASTE your money. I think it's a scam.
automotive_sad__Very dangerous Chinese made steering wheel. Not as same quality as Sparco, Nardi or Momo made in Italy.
automotive_sad__Don't waste your money! Too small doesn't cover half of the bottom portion of seat, High setting is barely enough to feel on back, keeps scrunching up on my back with a seam very uncomfortable, clips broke right of that hold on seat.
movies_happy__I really believe that this is the best story ever told on film. I have watched many movies in my lifetime, and none have been close to as powerful or as moving as this one.
movies_happy__Amazing! Continues the story line as the relationships fracture and yet leaves open the door for reconciliation as what will be needed for Infinity War. Introduces and also sets the table for some other stand alone movies. Again, absolutely amazing. Oh yeah, the Black Panther movie is going to be unbelievable.
movies_happy__This is a classic movie that should be seen by everybody. Based on the story by Stephen King, "The Shawshank Redemption" is a powerful movie filled with talented actors, a brilliant story, and more.
movies_happy__This might just be my new favorite Marvel movie.
movies_happy__Everything that was great about the early films with logical and necessary updates. Young and mature alike will easily fall in love with this film and include it among their all.time top favorites.
movies_happy__We all saw the movie. The movie was awesome. This 3D blue ray is ridiculously good. 3D has come along way. I can't believe how much it added to the experience. Literally makes you feel like you are watched live. Simply amazing.
movies_indifferent__Interesting and very somber. One gets what seems to be a few glimpses of what prison life must really be like-with a sort of Cinderella ending.
movies_indifferent__I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AS I NEVER WATCHED IT MYSELF HE SAID IT WAS OK.
movies_indifferent__A more significant concern I have is that the plot (and I know the source comes from the comics, but still...) very much resembles the plot of X-Men 3 when the heroes have to take sides on the issue of whether mutants should have to be registered and whether the mutant "cure" should even exist.
movies_indifferent__My husband and I watched Deadpool together. I wasn't fond of the language, but I'd been warned, so my 3 stars is based on content
movies_indifferent__This was an ok movie. My husband I rented it one night when the kids were not with us.
movies_indifferent__Harrison Ford looked bored throughout the entire movie. I am not sure why they even cast him it was obvious he didn't want to be in the movie. The story was kind of ho-hum..
movies_sad__This is an awful movie. Even by 80s standards it's possibly one of the worst, slow moving, jaw yapping so called horror films I have ever seen and I've seen some doozies. The movie is nothing but one long scene of inane boring dialogue after another with perhaps a split second of monster "scares" thrown in between. An entire hour and fifteen minutes goes by before any kind of excitement happens and it's pretty mediocre when it does. There isn't a single scare throughout, not a moment of suspense and subplots that go nowhere. Who cares that the photographer's girlfriend is pregnant, it had nothing to do with the story at all. And the extended shower scene that shows up if you click on the C.H.U.D.'s glowing eyes during the menu is identical to the scene in the movie, the only difference is you get to see the T&A that was cut out of the theatrical release.
movies_sad__Too much violence. Don't enjoy seeing violence
movies_sad__Marvel won't sucker me into watching another Avengers movie after this. The Ultron movie was a mess, but this was a disaster. Save your money and your time - buy a Classic Avengers comic and read when people actually believed in heroes.
movies_sad__To me the level of desperation in the attempt for over the top adult comedy was just annoying. It was just nonstop zingers. I enjoy some comedy but this movie felt desperate. Dead pool should stop here. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this rental.
movies_sad__Thanks for ruining the movie with crappy ads inside of it everytime the mouse moves over the screen ... also, it is NOT in HD it keeps going in and out of HD the quality was terrible. I want my money back.
movies_sad__Disappointed in the characters and lack luster script compared to earlier episodes
food_happy__I order these regularly. When I order from here we save a little but I think I would buy it anyways. But I do like that I can buy them a little cheaper here, and they get delivered to my house. But they are delicious!!! Refreshing too.
food_happy__love all flavors. My faves are the blue and purple cans. These taste great and 1/2 the sugar of coke and pepsi.
food_happy__I love double stuff Oreos!! Sometimes, I have a hard time just eating 2-3 when I have the whole bag in front of me, so this is a perfect solution because there are only 3 in each pack. Just grab one, and leave the others in the pantry!!
food_happy__Love those Oreos. And, since I tend to eat too many cookies at one sitting, these packages are great in limiting the # of Oreos.
food_happy__I Love Bragg's ACV! I drink it daily to help get rid of and control my infants thrush. It's pretty strong but I know it works. And I use it in my laundry to get rid of odors. There's so many uses for acv and I really think this is top quality.
food_happy__My Bananas were perfect, inside and out. could not have picked them better myself. This was my first purchase from Amazon Fresh, I could not be more pleased with the outcome.
food_indifferent__I wish they'd replace the fake sugar with real sugar and reduce the sweetness at the same time.
food_indifferent__It has a very artificial taste, but it's one of lowest-calorie drinks available.
food_indifferent__These were ok. I say that because when I opened the box the individual packets were glued to the large cardboard flap and when I tried to pull them off, it ripped open the oreo packages.
food_indifferent__I've been drinking this brand of apple cider vinegar for about 2 years now. I drink a cap full with a glass of water daily, so I know exactly how this vinegar taste. Something has definitely changed. I was able to tell the difference immediately with this particular order.
food_indifferent__The bananas did come in great shape. There were no bruises and they were medium sized.
food_indifferent__One of the bunch arrived bruised and the rest batch molded quickly (within 3 days), but they were fine for the first few days (except that bruised one).
food_sad__Very disappointed. 2 out of the 10 cans were so dented that the cans severely sunken in. I actually have never seen cans sunk in like this.
food_sad__The box was opened when i received looked inside there were only 5 packages of cookies when it clearly states 12 packages the rest of them were broken!! What a scam!!
food_sad__Stale, inedible.
food_sad__Never had a chance to try it.. Item arrived with cracked twist on top and plastic security seal unsecured.. It appears to have already been previously opened and/or tampered with...Very disappointed and quite unsettling..
food_sad__muddy,smells and tastes different than the original Bragg's organic apple cider. bought it for amazon prime but wasted my money.
food_sad__Very disappointed with my first Amazon fresh delivery. Bananas were squished and overly ripe. Not even good for smoothies, they ended up in the trash. Such a waste!
